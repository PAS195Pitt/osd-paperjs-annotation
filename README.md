# osd-annotation - Annotation tools for Openseadragon

This project combines the [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/) zoomable image viewer with [PaperJS](http://paperjs.org/)-based annotations drawn within a zoomable overlay synced to the OpenSeadragon viewer.

## Demo pages:
View and annotate slides from any [Digital Slide Archive instance](demo/dsa/app.html). Enter the base URL for the DSA in the box and press the "Open DSA" button. Some archives may have publically available slides to view, but to save changes you will need to be logged in.
